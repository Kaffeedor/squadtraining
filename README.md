squad training stuff

To Do:

    > add VC-member counter ("Playing with [number of people in vc] Squaddies");
    
    > Set the pictures of the embeds right.
    
    > Get the Set Presence Command to work (admin/dev command).
    
    > A Set Avatar and Set Username command (admin/dev command).
    
    > A command to set the color of the embeds for each role (admin/dev command) maybe.
    
    > Make the rolelist not hard-coded for one guild but flexible and also just for each role take the role color and role name.

    > Set Colors and Set Images (links) as subcommands next to "create" (which currently is the main/only one), also make it flexible
