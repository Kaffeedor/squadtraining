squad training stuff

FileOperations.js causing some trouble still need to figure out whats wrong, after that I will work on the roleUpdate.js and then copy that code to memberLeave/kick, after that when i have enough enery, ill work on the VC-member counter

To Do:

    > add VC-member counter ("Playing with [number of people in vc] Squaddies");
    
    > Set the pictures and colors of the embeds right.
    
    > Get the Set Presence Command to work (admin/dev command).
