squad training stuff

WHY THE HELL DOES THE ROLE THINGY COMMAND ONLY SHOW WHEN cato#0487 (me) HAS A ROLE AND ELSE IT IS EMPTY AND ALSO DOESNT SHOW OTHER MEMBERS WITH THE SAME ROLE????!?!!!?!?!
discord-js is so weird

To Do:

    > add VC-member counter ("Playing with [number of people in vc] Squaddies");

    > Get the role list command working.
    
    > Set the pictures of the embeds right.
    
    > Get the Set Presence Command to work (admin/dev command).
    
    > A Set Avatar and Set Username command (admin/dev command).
    
    > Set Nickname Command (admin/dev command).
    
    > A command to set the color of the embeds for each role (admin/dev command).
    
    > Make the rolelist not hard-coded for one guild but flexible and also just for each role take the role color and role name.

    > Set Colors and Set Images (links) as subcommands next to "create" (which currently is the main/only one), also make it flexible
