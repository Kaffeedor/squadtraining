squad training stuff

Info:
    The File Data is appending in case it is gonna get more dynamic in the Future with editing specific RoleList Embeds etc. It is not really needed right now.

To Do:

    > add VC-member counter ("Playing with [number of people in vc] Squaddies");
    
    > Set the pictures and colors of the embeds right.
    
    > Get the Set Presence Command to work (admin/dev command) or remove it.
